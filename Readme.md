TODO I still need to write something here

TODO I also need to make more sections

TODO also make the Building section sound better

## Building Galp from source

There are automated scripts for building and cleaning Galp directly from this source repository.

After downloading the repository, Galp can be built by running the 'buildjava' script from a terminal.
There's a bash script provided for Unix platforms, and a batch file for Windows.

After building, you can run Galp directly from the command line with 'java -jar build/galp.jar' if you're in the root 'galp' folder.

There's also a script provided for cleaning previous build files titled 'clean'. It's recommended to always clean before starting a fresh build. Again, there's a bash script provided for Unix platforms, and a batch file for Windows.

### Dependencies

In order to build Galp you must have the JDK (Java Developement Kit) installed and on your PATH.
This can be freely downloaded from Java website. Any version 8 or higher is fine.
